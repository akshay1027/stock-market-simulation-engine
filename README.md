## APIs:
1) CRUD on meta data for companies | Not for users | Private API
2) Read API on stock prise of a company | For users | Public API
   This API has to update the base prise using some formula.


## Frontend:
1) Using Read API, show charts of prise changing for each company.


## Todo 3|3|23:
Am able to make the companies but there is some problem with editing the companies. I have sem exam on 7|3|23. I will continue again from that day.
